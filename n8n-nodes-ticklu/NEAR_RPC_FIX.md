# 🔧 NEAR RPC Provider Fix

## 🚨 **Issue Fixed:**

**Problem**: NEAR RPC endpoint was deprecated and had rate limits exceeded
```
Ticklu Error: {"jsonrpc": "2.0", "error": {"code": -429, "message": "WARNING! This endpoint is deprecated. Rate limits exceeded. For higher rate limits, try https://fastnear.com or other RPC providers at https://docs.near.org/api/rpc/providers"}, "id": "1"}
```

## ✅ **Solution Implemented:**

### **Multi-Provider RPC Strategy**
- ✅ **Primary**: `https://rpc.fastnear.com` (recommended by NEAR)
- ✅ **Backup 1**: `https://near.lava.build` (Lava Network)
- ✅ **Backup 2**: `https://rpc.mainnet.near.org` (original)
- ✅ **Backup 3**: `https://rpc.near.org` (alternative)

### **Automatic Failover**
- ✅ **Connection Testing**: Tests each RPC provider before use
- ✅ **Automatic Switching**: Falls back to next provider if one fails
- ✅ **Detailed Logging**: Shows which provider is being used
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Provides clear error messages

## 🚀 **How It Works:**

### **Step 1: Try Primary Provider**
```
🔄 Trying RPC provider: https://rpc.fastnear.com
✅ Connected to RPC provider: https://rpc.fastnear.com
```

### **Step 2: Automatic Failover**
If primary fails:
```
❌ Failed to connect to https://rpc.fastnear.com: Rate limit exceeded
🔄 Trying RPC provider: https://near.lava.build
✅ Connected to RPC provider: https://near.lava.build
```

### **Step 3: Transaction Execution**
Once connected, executes the NEAR transaction normally.

## 🎯 **Benefits:**

- ✅ **No More Rate Limits**: Uses providers with higher limits
- ✅ **Better Reliability**: Multiple fallback options
- ✅ **Faster Performance**: FastNear.com is optimized for speed
- ✅ **Automatic Recovery**: Handles provider failures gracefully
- ✅ **Clear Logging**: Shows exactly what's happening

## 📋 **RPC Providers Used:**

1. **FastNear.com** - Primary (recommended by NEAR team)
2. **Lava Network** - Backup (reliable infrastructure)
3. **Mainnet.near.org** - Fallback (original endpoint)
4. **Rpc.near.org** - Final fallback (alternative)

## 🎉 **Result:**

The NEAR node will now:
- ✅ **Connect successfully** to available RPC providers
- ✅ **Handle rate limits** automatically
- ✅ **Execute transactions** without RPC errors
- ✅ **Provide clear feedback** about which provider is used

**The NEAR RPC issue is now completely resolved!** 🎉
